# Apps

What is an app? A user uses it to do something. Finding stuff, editing stuff, creating stuff; the bottom line is that a user asks the things through their interation with the UI and app answers with changes in the display layer

Perhaps the app needs to load data from an external source like a Database or API. Perhaps it needs to send commands to Micros Services. Perhas it needs authentication, perhaps not. These are all features & there's really nothing new under the sun

In this scenario I've simply decided on a set of features to implement for this MVP. It's a small subset of what's available. It doesn't need endless discussion, planning or time to implement. We need a form which creates a database record? No problem, I'll go and grab the Forms module, the Uberedux module, create a form, create the actions I need and very quickly spin up the requirement. More quickly than with retool and with MUCH more flexibility and control

Now tell me.... how does retool fit into that? A simple answer please. What possible benefit do you think you're going to gain by adding the complex dependency of something like that to the Admin Portal?

Here is an analagy. I've tried to make it accessible and funny. Lets's say our Web Team is a Building team. A client wants a 2 story house and invites us to take a look at his rough foundations. We take a look as think 'hmmm, I don't really know how to do stairs'. Then we go back to the client and say  "We don't think we need stairs. We'll park a cherry picker up next to the house and you can go up and down with that". Oh and buy the way, that cherry picker is going to cost you Â£5K a year to hire

Really? we're still talking. OK, this is the biggest of big guns. I actually spoke to Jamie about this at alignment day, because I'm a bit like that. He asked. Harsh witnessed. I outlined the retool decision and he immediately understood that's it a shit idea. Ask him. Please. Because I don't know what more to say
