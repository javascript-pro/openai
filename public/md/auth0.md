To implement Auth0 authentication in an Next.js app with the entire application behind an authentication wall...

1. Install Auth0 SDK

Install the official Auth0 SDK for Next.js:

`yarn workspace admin-portal add @auth0/nextjs-auth0`

2. Set Up Environment Variables

Add the necessary Auth0 configuration to your .env.local file in the root of your Next.js project:

AUTH0_SECRET=your-random-secret
AUTH0_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL=https://your-tenant.auth0.com
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret

	•	Replace your-random-secret with a securely generated random string.
	•	Replace your-tenant.auth0.com, your-client-id, and your-client-secret with your Auth0 tenant details from the Auth0 dashboard.
	•	Update the AUTH0_BASE_URL for your production environment (e.g., https://your-deployed-app.netlify.app).

Updated Step 3: Configure Auth0 in app/api/auth/[...auth0]/route.js

In the App Router, API routes are defined using the route.js file. Create a new dynamic route under app/api/auth/[...auth0]/route.js:
	1.	Create the directory app/api/auth/[...auth0].
	2.	Inside it, create the route.js file:

> This configures the necessary Auth0 authentication endpoints, including /api/auth/login, /api/auth/logout, and /api/auth/callback.

4. Add a Middleware for Securing Routes

Use Next.js middleware to protect the entire app behind an Auth0 authentication wall. Create middleware.js in the root of your project:

import { withAuth } from '@auth0/nextjs-auth0/edge';

export default withAuth();

This ensures that all routes are protected and require authentication.

5. Access User Information in Your App

To access user information in your app, use the useUser hook provided by the Auth0 SDK. For example:

import { useUser } from '@auth0/nextjs-auth0';

export default function Home() {
  const { user, error, isLoading } = useUser();

  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>{error.message}</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome, {user?.name}!</h1>
      <a href="/api/auth/logout">Logout</a>
    </div>
  );
}

6. Deploy to Netlify

Update the .env variables in your Netlify project settings to match your local .env.local. This includes:
	•	AUTH0_SECRET
	•	AUTH0_BASE_URL (set to your Netlify app’s URL)
	•	AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL
	•	AUTH0_CLIENT_ID
	•	AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET

Netlify will inject these into the runtime environment during the build and execution of your app.

7. Configure Auth0 Application

In your Auth0 dashboard:
	1.	Go to your Application settings.
	2.	Add the following URLs:
	•	Allowed Callback URLs: http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback and your Netlify URL, e.g., https://your-app.netlify.app/api/auth/callback.
	•	Allowed Logout URLs: http://localhost:3000 and your Netlify URL.
	•	Allowed Web Origins: http://localhost:3000 and your Netlify URL.

8. Test Your Application

	1.	Start the dev server locally: yarn dev.
	2.	Visit your app. You should be redirected to the Auth0 login page.
	3.	Log in, and you’ll be returned to your app as an authenticated user.
	4.	Test the deployment on Netlify to confirm everything works in production.
