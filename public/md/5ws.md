# The 5Ws

> By structuring a presentation around these 5Ws, you ensure that all critical information is covered, making it easier for stakeholders to grasp the proposal scope and relevance

The 5Ws—Who, What, When, Where, and Why—are journalistic principles used to provide a comprehensive understanding of a subject. Here’s how you can use them to make your presentation clear to your CTO:

1. Who: Identify key stakeholders or individuals involved (e.g., team members, users, or clients). This helps set the context of who the presentation is relevant to.

2. What: Define the topic, problem, or solution. Clearly explain what you’re addressing, such as a new feature, an issue in the system, or an improvement suggestion.

3. When: Specify timeframes, such as deadlines, milestones, or implementation periods. This helps your CTO understand timelines for the proposed changes.

4. Where: Indicate where changes or impacts will occur. This could mean identifying the parts of a system or software that will be affected.

5. Why: Justify the importance or need for the discussion. Explain why your proposed solution or topic matters, emphasizing its impact on the business or technical objectives.
