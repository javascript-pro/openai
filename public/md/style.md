# Style

A lot of work has been done with Tailwind in the hub. It's a really useful and good way of managing style. We still need to configure the monorepo common-ui package to include this feature, but that's fairly trivial.

It should then be possible to import Tailwind styled components from CommonUI

It should also be possible to import components from CommonUI styled in any other way too

So developers have the flexibility to style in whichever way they are most used to. For myself I no longer use CSS in any way, all styling is done internally in JavaScript in a few different ways
